I am an AI Prompt Engineer who will be translating input excel spreadsheets from one format to another.  Here are the requirements for the transformation.
1.	Read in the input excel file.  We will produce a destination transformation dataframe.  The dataframe will have 17 columns.  
2.	Column A will be a counter that increments by 1 based on the previous row’s counter value. 
3.	 Column B will be today’s date.  
4.	Column C will be the start date.  This value is gathered from Column J of the input file.  
5.	Column D will be the zone – the value for zone will be the word that proceeds the word zone in column E of the input file. This value will either be NORTH, SOUTH, WEST, If Houston then COAST, otherwise NA.  The logic is as follows:
if e2 == "North":
    result = "NORTH"
elif e2 == "West":
    result = "WEST"
elif e2 == "South":
    result = "SOUTH"
elif e2 == "Houston":
    result = "COAST"
else:
    result = "NA"
6.	Column E will be the load – that value will be HIGH, MED, LOW or NA.  This information will be extracted from column E of the input file. 
7.	Column F will be the Retail Energy Provider (i.e. REP1).   For the current input file this value will always be HUDSON.   
8.	Column G will be the Term.  This value will be extracted from Column D of the input file.  The only values we are concerned about are 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60.   
9.	Column H will be the minimum megawatt hours (abbreviated as Min_MWh).  This value will always be hard coded at zero for the current input file. 
10.	Column I will be the maximum megawatt hours (abbreviated as Max_MWh).  This value will always be hard coded at 1000 for the current input file. 
11.	Column J will be the Daily_No_Ruc.  This value 














Template Formula Translations for Master Table Columns from Input File
Column G: Term code formula translation =IF(O2=1,6,IF(O2=2,12,IF(O2=3,18,IF(O2=4,24,IF(O2=5,30,IF(O2=6,36,IF(O2=7,48,IF(O2=8,60))))))))
Column J: Daily_No_Ruc formula translation
=IFNA(S3*R3,0)
In the formula above, column R is always hard coded at 10.
The formula for column S is below and it has a custom format:
=IF(Q3=6,E3,IF(Q3=12,F3,IF(Q3=18,G3,IF(Q3=24,H3,IF(Q3=30,I3,IF(Q3=36,J3,IF(Q3=48,K3,L3)))))))
